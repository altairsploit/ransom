# `ransom`

This is a small malicious set of ransomware scripts. The scripts are intended to
run on a victim's computer to encrypt and store all files in the target
directory in a database, deleting all the originals.

The scripts also provide a mechanism to recover the files using a secret key.

**NOTE: This is malicious software created for learning purposes. Please do not
execute these scripts. They can cause irreversible data loss.**
